Knowing the size and shape of the particles involved in a reaction is of considerable importance in control engineering. Our team, supervised by Lucas Brivadis, a researcher at the Signals and Systems Laboratory, set out to solve the problem posed by current Laser metrology techniques, which provide only partial information about them: a distribution in chord lengths.
We sought to match this mathematical object with the one of interest to engineers: the particle size distribution. While the transition from sizes to chords was relatively straightforward, solving the inverse problem required the use of an optimization procedure involving a hyper-parameter, the Tikhonov regularization.
As you can see, the results obtained for the direct problem are satisfactory for the simple case of spheroids. In the case of polyhedra, the profile of the CLD obtained corresponds to the solid from which it is derived.
The results obtained using Tikhonov's method are also good, even in the presence of noise.
We have also explored another approach, more abstract, consisting in mathematically representing the notion of shape within sets called shape spaces. This original approach seems promising, as it is capable of quantifying the difference between two solids, disregarding translations, scalings, rotations and reflections, the latter result we demonstrate taking inspiration from the litterature.
In the wake of Lucas Brivadis' work, we propose then several ways of understanding particle size and shape.
